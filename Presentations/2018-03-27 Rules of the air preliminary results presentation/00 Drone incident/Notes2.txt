The NTBS cited a drone pilot`s decision to fly past LOS, 
above 400 feet (controlled airspace) intro active TFR as causes and contribution to the September 21st collision between
private DJI Panthon 4 sUAS and U.S Army Back Hawk over Hoffman island in New York harbor.
The helicopter sustained minor damage and landed without incident.
The UAS operated by Vyacheslav Tantashov(58) of Brooklyn was destroyed.
