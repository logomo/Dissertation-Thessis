\section{(W) Moving Obstacles - Intruders and Constraints}\label{s:intruders}
    \noindent Fast overview of obstacles and space constraints which position is dynamic relative to mission or avoidance time frame:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Non-cooperative intruders
        \item Short term bad weather areas (constraints)
        \item The models are based on \emph{analytical geometry} for \emph{cones and ellipsoids} taken from \cite{sommerville2016analytical}.
        \item The cell boundary was approximated as set of points, the intersection objects were discretized.
        \item Closes point problem \cite{shamos1975closest} was solved by application of method  \cite{bentley1980optimal}
		\item Moving obstacles were adressed in \cite{fiorini1998motion}.
		\item Lidar like intersection rebase the obstacle or intruder into pointcloud with evaluated impact rate ...
    \end{itemize}
    
TODO new section look to Storm scenario structure

The algorithm used for intersection selected based on:\citep{bentley1979algorithms} the selected algorithm  \emph{Shamos-Hoey} \cite{shamos1976geometric}.
