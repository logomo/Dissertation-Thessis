\chapter{\secState{R}Problem Statement}\label{c:problemStatement}

\noindent An \emph{UAV} equipped with several types of sensors is tasked to fly several types of \emph{Missions} in a 3-dimensional space. There is a \emph{Terrain} map, an \emph{Object map}, and a \emph{Weather} forecast for target region that are  known a priori. The map of the \emph{Terrain} may not be up to date and \emph{Uncharted obstacles} may affect flight safety. The \emph{UAV} has to comply to a set of \emph{Flight Rules} specifying \emph{Flight Constraints}. The performance of the \emph{UAV}, including sensor performance, is affected by the \emph{Weather}.


Several difficulties must be faced.  First, the design space of is large and complex. Second, \emph{Trajectory calculation} Third, \emph{Navigation}.
