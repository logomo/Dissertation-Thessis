    \toprule
     Terminology &Definition  \\\hline
    \midrule
    \endhead
     Air Traffic Control & A service operated by appropriate authority to promote the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic\\\hline
     Aircraft & A device that is used or intended to be used for flight in the air\\\hline
     Airspace & Any portion of the atmosphere sustaining aircraft flight and which has defined boundaries and specified dimensions. Airspace may be classified as to the specific types of flight allowed, rules of operation, and restrictions by International Civil Aviation Organization standards or State regulation\\\hline
     Civil Aircraft & Another than public aircraft. \\\hline
     Collision \mbox{Avoidance} & The Sense and Avoid system function where the UAS takes appropriate action to prevent an intruder from penetrating the collision volume. The action is expected to be initiated within a relatively short time horizon before the closest point of approach. The collision avoidance function engages when all other modes of separation fail.\\\hline
     Communication Link & The voice or data relay of instructions or information between the UAS pilot and the air traffic controller and other NAS users.\\\hline
     Control Station & The equipment used to maintain control, communicate with, guide, or otherwise pilot an unmanned aircraft.\\\hline
     Crewmember (UAS) & In addition to the crewmembers identified in 14 CFR Part 1, a UAS flightcrew member includes pilots, sensor/payload operators, and visual observers, but may include other persons as appropriate or required to ensure safe operation of the aircraft.\\\hline
     Data Link & A ground-to-air communications system which transmits information via digitally coded pulses.\\\hline
     Detect and Avoid & A term used instead of Sense and Avoid in the Terms of Reference for RTCA Special Committee 228. This new term has not been defined by RTCA and may be considered to have the same definition as Sense and Avoid when used in this document.\\\hline
     ICAO & International Civil Aviation Organization is a specialized agency of the United Nations whose objective is to develop the principles and techniques of international air navigation and to foster the planning and development of international civil air transport.\\\hline
     Manned Aircraft & Aircraft piloted by a human onboard.\\\hline
     RTCA & RTCA, Inc. is a private, not-for-profit corporation that develops consensus-based recommendations regarding communications, navigation, surveillance, and air traffic management system issues. RTCA functions as a Federal Advisory Committee. The FAA uses its recommendations as the basis for policy, program, and regulatory decisions and by the private sector as the basis for development, investment and other business decisions  (\url{www.rtca.org})\\\hline
     See and Avoid & When weather conditions permit, pilots operating instrument flight rules or visual flight rules are required to observe and maneuver to avoid another aircraft. \\\hline
     Self-Separation & Sense and Avoid system function where the UAS maneuvers within a sufficient time-frame to remain well clear of other airborne traffic.\\\hline 
     Sense and Avoid & The capability of a UAS to remain well clear from and avoid collisions with other airborne traffic. Sense and Avoid provides the functions of self-separation and collision avoidance to establish an analogous capability to “see and avoid” required by manned aircraft.\\\hline
     Unmanned Aircraft & 1.~ A device used or intended to be used for flight in the air that has no onboard pilot. This device excludes missiles, weapons, or exploding warheads, but includes all classes of airplanes, helicopters, airships, and powered-lift aircraft without an onboard pilot.\\
     &2.~An aircraft that is operated without the possibility of direct human intervention from within or on the aircraft.\\\hline
     Unmanned Aircraft System & An unmanned aircraft and its associated elements related to safe operations, which may include control stations (ground, ship, or air-based), control links, support equipment, payloads, flight termination systems, and launch/recovery equipment.\\
     &~An unmanned aircraft and associated elements (including communications links and the components that control the unmanned aircraft) that are required for the pilot-in-command to operate safely and efficiently in the national airspace system. \\\hline
     Visual Line of Sight & Unaided (corrective lenses and/or sunglasses exempted) visual contact between a pilot-in-command or a visual observer and a UAS sufficient to maintain safe operational control of the aircraft, know its location, and be able to scan the airspace in which it is operating to see and avoid other air traffic or objects aloft or on the ground.\\
