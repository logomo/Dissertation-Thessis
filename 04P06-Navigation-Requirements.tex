\section{Navigation Requirements}\label{s:navigationRequirements}
\noindent \emph{Navigation requirements} are not the  main part of this work; they are used to show the variability of the approach for \emph{DAA} requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Contextual behavior} - change navigation and decision behavior based on context:
    \begin{enumerate}[a.]
        \item \emph{Airspace type} - Controlled/Uncontrolled, 
        \item \emph{Navigation mode} - Cooperative/Emergency. 
    \end{enumerate}    
    
    \item \emph{Determinism} - same result for same dataset in finite time.
    
    \item  \emph{Threat prioritization} - threats prioritization based on \emph{context}, (tab. \ref{tab:controlledAirspaceViolations}) and (tab. \ref{tab:uncontrolledAirspaceViolations}).
    
    \item \emph{Rule compliance} - compliance with a given set of rules based on context (focus on rules of the air).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{S{0.25}||S{0.65}}
    Requirement & Evaluation metrics \\ \hline\hline
    Constrained space navigation & Mission scenario does not have a direct path between waypoints, additional borderline cases.\\\hline
    Contextual behavior & Avoidance system changes behavior based on the mission and vehicle context.\\\hline
    Determinism & Multiple runs of same non-borderline scenario returns same avoidance paths.\\\hline
    Rule compliance & Rules applied comply with aviation standardization.\\
