\subsection{Mission Control Run}\label{s:missionControlRun}

\paragraph{Summary:} Event-based navigation algorithm connecting results of the multiple Avoidance Grid Runs over time to generate a trajectory satisfying the mission. The concept of discrete future events is introduced to support the processing of various threats and commands. The overview of process description and thread orchestration is provided.


\paragraph{Introduction and Motivation:}  This section will introduce \emph{Navigation Concept} using  \emph{Reach Set Approximation}. The \emph{Avoidance Framework Concept} (fig. \ref{fig:AvoidanceFrameworkConceptNew}) defines \emph{Navigation Module} as a \emph{sub-system} for long term \emph{trajectory tracking}.  The \emph{Avoidance Grid Run} (sec. \ref{s:aviudabceGridRun}) is solving the \emph{Path Search} problem inside operation space constrained by \emph{Avoidance Grid} for time $t_i$. 

There is a need to build a trajectory between \emph{Waypoints} which are further away than the \emph{distance} of one \emph{Avoidance Grid}.  The \emph{UAS} is controlled via \emph{Movement Automaton}. The \emph{Movements} which are in \emph{Movement Buffer} can be replaced with other movements. This feature of \emph{Movement Automaton} is called \emph{Movement Chaining} (eq. \ref{eq:movementChaining}).

To join the multiple \emph{Avoidance Grids} paths following terminology needs to be established (fig. \ref{fig:missionControlRunExample}):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Goal} (Selecting Goal of Navigation) - the point where UAS want to get in the global coordinate frame. The selection needs to be defined.
    
    \item \emph{Next Decision} - the point when the next \emph{Avoidance Grid Run} is applied. The outline of events and triggers is required. The \emph{decision} will be made in the \emph{next decision time} $t_{i+1}$.
\end{enumerate}

    \label{fig:definitionsForMissionControlRun}
\end{figure}

\noindent The \emph{Avoidance Grid} from \emph{UAS} viewpoint can be separated into following zones (fig. \ref{fig:gridZonesMissionControl}):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Crash Area} (last layers) - there is no place for safe return and the \emph{border} of \emph{Avoidance Grid} is near. The \emph{Decision Point} needs to lie before this zone.
    
    \item \emph{Avoidance Area} (middle layers) - the area of \emph{Active Avoidance Maneuvering}. The \emph{Reach Set Approximation} performance (sec. \ref{s:ReachSetPerformanceCriteria}) is important in this area.
    
    \item \emph{Safe Zone} (first layers) - there is space for safe return or damage mitigation.
\end{enumerate}



\noindent Joining \emph{Avoidance Grid Runs} (fig. \ref{fig:joiningMultipleAGRS})  example portrays \emph{Avoidance Grid Runs} invoked on various \emph{Decision Points} to achieve \emph{Navigation} functionality. The UAS (blue plane) is flying Mission (green numbered waypoints). The \emph{Avoidance Grid} boundary (black dashed line) for each \emph{Decision Point} (UAS position at time $t_i$). Following the example of \emph{Navigation} (fig. \ref{fig:missionControlRunActivityDiagram}) run is shown:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Mission Start} (fig. \ref{fig:missionExampleWithOAGR}) - UAS at the start of the mission have one \emph{Avoidance Grid} at its position to determine the \emph{Navigation Path} to \emph{Waypoint 2} (goal waypoint). The planned path (red line) is leading directly to \emph{Avoidance Grid} boundary (black dashed line).
    
    \item \emph{Mission End} (fig. \ref{fig:finishedMissionAGR}) - UAS have reached 
    the \emph{last waypoint}. All \emph{Avoidance Grid} boundaries (black dashed line) for all \emph{runs} are drawn along flown trajectory. 
    
    \item \emph{Waypoint Reach} (fig. \ref{fig:waypointReachAGR}) - the \emph{waypoint} is inside \emph{Avoidance Grid}, the navigation path (red line) leads directly to \emph{goal waypoint}. (Excessive \emph{Avoidance Grid} boundaries are removed.)
    
    \item \emph{Next Waypoint} (fig. \ref{fig:newtWaypointAGR}) - the new \emph{Goal Waypoint} is selected, the UAS moves to new goal (invoking \emph{Avoidance Grid Runs} when necessary).

\paragraph{General Concept:}\footnote{Mission Control Run Function Implementation: \url{RuleEngine/MissionControl/MissionControl.m::runOnce(.)}} The \emph{General Concept} is taken from  \cite{sabatini2014navigation,Sabatini2014}, consisting of following main modules:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Navigation Loop} - module responsible for \emph{Navigation} providing \emph{Goal Waypoint}.
    
    \item \emph{Data Fusion} (background in sec. \ref{s:sensorFusion}) - module responsible for \emph{Surveillance Data Feed}.
    
    \item \emph{Situation Assessment} - module responsible for \emph{UAS Safety Evaluation}. 
    
    \item \emph{Avoidance Run} (background in sec. \ref{s:aviudabceGridRun}) responsible for \emph{Avoidance Path} selection.    
\end{enumerate}


\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{\FIGDIR/TE026AvoidanceAlgorithmMainLoopRun}
    \caption{Mission control run activity diagram.}
    \label{fig:missionControlRunActivityDiagram}
\end{figure}

\noindent The main changes to \emph{Navigation architecture} are given in \emph{Mission Control Run} activity diagram (fig. \ref{fig:missionControlRunActivityDiagram}):

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Situation Assessment} - added event-based mode switching control. 
   
    \item \emph{Avoidance Run} - added hierarchical evaluation for \emph{Avoidance Path} selection; This is responsible for prioritizing threat avoidance according to a type. 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The \emph{Operation Mode} is introduced, based on \emph{Situation assessment} and \emph{Triggering Events} one of the following modes are selected in \emph{Avoidance Run}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Navigation Mode} - the \emph{UAS} is navigating through \emph{Airspace} following \emph{cost-effective patterns} and obeying \emph{Airspace Authority} (UTM). The \emph{Navigation Grid} is an instance of \emph{Avoidance Grid} (sec. \ref{s:AvoidanceGrid}) with initialized \emph{Navigation Reach Set} (ex. \emph{Turn-Minimizing Reach Set Approximation} (sec. \ref{s:harmonicReachSet})).
    
    \item \emph{Emergency Avoidance Mode} - the \emph{UAS} is \emph{threatened} by obstacle, intruder, hard constraint or \emph{soft constraint}, the \emph{UAS} is navigating through \emph{Airspace} following \emph{safe avoidance patterns} and \emph{minimizing the impact} of possible damages. The \emph{Avoidance Grid} is a term used for \emph{Emergency Avoidance Mode}. The \emph{Avoidance Reach Set Approximation} is initialized in \emph{Avoidance Grid} (ex. \emph{Coverage-Maximizing Reach Set Approximation} (sec. \ref{s:chaoticReachSet}))
\end{enumerate}

\begin{note}
    Depending on \emph{Operation Mode} the pair of \emph{Avoidance Grid} and \emph{Reach Set} is selected in \emph{Avoidance Run} part.
    
    
    The \emph{Navigation Grid} and \emph{Avoidance Grid} share the space portioning pattern; therefore the \emph{Data Fusion} (sec. \ref{s:sensorFusion}) needs to be evaluated only once for both grids. 
\end{note}



\paragraph{Decision Time Frame ($[t_i,t_{i+1}[$):} The \emph{Mission Control Run} is executed for \emph{Decision Time Frame} bounded to the \emph{period} of the \emph{UAS executed movement} (fig. \ref{fig:AvoidanceFrameworkConceptNew}).

The \emph{UAS System} (sec. \ref{s:UASNonlinearModel}) controlled by \emph{Movement Automaton Implementation} (sec. \ref{s:movementAutomatonDefinition}) \emph{Planned Movements} can be changed at any time. The real impact on control is shown after the \emph{actual movement} is executed. 

\begin{note}
    For our \emph{Movement Automaton Implementation} movements, the average \emph{movement duration} is \emph{1/velocity second} (tab. \ref{tab:movements1}, \ref{tab:movements2}).
\end{note}

The \emph{Decisions} are made based on \emph{system} state in \emph{current} time-frame started at $t_i$ for the \emph{next} time frame starting at $t_{i+1}$.

\begin{note}
    Because the \emph{Decision Delay} is crucial in \emph{Avoidance System}, it is beneficial to have \emph{short time movements}. On the other hands, the \emph{length and duration  of movements} are impacting \emph{Reach Set Complexity}. The proper construction of movement automaton is greatly impacting overall \emph{approach performance}.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Initialization:} The \emph{UAS} is going to solve a problem for \emph{Rules of the Air} (eq. \ref{eq:rulesOfTheAir}). Using control scheme (fig. \ref{fig:AvoidanceFrameworkConceptNew}) with given \emph{Sensors}:

\begin{equation}
    Sensors = \{LiDAR,ADS-B\}
\end{equation}

\noindent The sensors obstacle assessment into avoidance grid is outlined for static obstacles in (sec. \ref{s:staticObstacles}) and for moving obstacles in (sec. \ref{s:intruders}.)

\noindent The \emph{Data Fusion Procedure} is given as follow:
\begin{equation}
    DataFusion = \{Rating Based Data Fusion \quad (sec. \ref{s:sensorFusion})\}
\end{equation}

Then the \emph{UAS system} (sec. \ref{s:UASNonlinearModel}) with \emph{Movement Automaton Implementation} (sec. \ref{s:movementAutomatonDefinition}) with empty movement buffer:

\begin{equation}
    Movement Buffer = \{\}
\end{equation}

\noindent The \emph{Avoidance Grids} for both \emph{Operation Modes} are created with \emph{identical space segmentation}. The \emph{Reach Set Approximations} are loaded based on initial \emph{UAS State} at decision time $0$. The \emph{Reach Set Approximation} is always selected based on \emph{UAS System State}. The initial \emph{Operation Mode} is set up as \emph{Navigation}. The initialization is summarized like follow:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    Avoidance Grid(0) &= \{UAS.position(0),AvoidanceReachSet(UAS.ReachSet)\}\\
    Navigation Grid (0) &= \{UAS.position(0), NavigationReachSet(UAS.ReachSet)\}\\
    Operation Mode &= Navigation
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The \emph{Mission} is set up as a set of \emph{ordered waypoints}. The \emph{initial goal waypoint} is \emph{first waypoint}. The initialization is summarized like follow:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    Mission &= \{Waypoint_1 \dots  Waypoint_n\}\\
    Goal Waypoint &= Mission.waypoint_1\\
    Last Waypoint &= Mission.waypoint_n\\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The \emph{actual threats} are set as empty sets for \emph{decision time} $t_i=0$:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    obstacles &= \{\}, intruders = \{\}, hard Constraints = \{\}, soft Constraints = \{\}\\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}



\paragraph{Navigation Loop (1\textsuperscript{st}-3\textsuperscript{rd} step):} The purpose of \emph{Navigation Loop} is to select proper \emph{Goal Waypoint} from \emph{Mission} (sec. \ref{s:mission}). If \emph{last waypoint} have been reached the \emph{Landing Procedure} will be initiated and \emph{Mission Control Run} Ends.

First, start with the definition of \emph{waypoint reach condition} (def. \ref{def:waypointReachCondition}) and \emph{Unreachable waypoint} (def. \ref{def:unreachable Waypoint}).

\begin{definition}{Waypoint Reach Condition}\label{def:waypointReachCondition} for \emph{current} decision time $t_i$ for \emph{UAS} position and current \emph{Goal Waypoint} is satisfied only if:

\begin{multline}\label{eq:waypointReachCondition}
    distance(UAS.position(t_i),GoalWaypoint(t_i)) \\\le \\2 \times \max \left\{length(movement):\forall movement\in MovementSet\right\}
\end{multline}

    \begin{note}
        The movements in our solution have a \emph{uniform length} of \emph{1 m} (tab. \ref{tab:movements1}, \ref{tab:movements2}), therefore the waypoint reach condition is satisfied when the \emph{distance to goal waypoint} is lesser than 2 m. The maximal movement length has an impact on \emph{navigation/avoidance} precision.
    \end{note}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Unreachable Waypoint}\label{def:unreachable Waypoint}. The \emph{Goal Waypoint} evaluates as unreachable in decision time $t_i$ when \emph{Avoidance Grid Run} (alg. \ref{alg:FindBestPathAvoidanceGrid}) cannot find the \emph{navigation/avoidance path} leading to it.

\noindent Formally: The \emph{Avoidance/Navigation Grid} has range defined as \emph{final layer distance}. When the \emph{Goal Waypoint} is in  \emph{range} of \emph{Grid}:

\begin{equation}
    Grid(t_i).range \ge distance(UAS.position(t_i),GoalWaypoint(t_i))
\end{equation}

\noindent and following condition is satisfied:

\begin{multline}\label{eq:unreachableWaypoint}
    \forall cell_{i,j,k}\in Grid(t_i) \not\exists cell_{i,j,k}. Reachable == true \wedge\dots  \\\dots\wedge distance(cell_{i,j,k}, Goal Waypoint(t_i)) \le\dots \\ \dots\le 2 \times \max \left\{length(movement):\forall movement\in MovementSet\right\}
\end{multline}

\noindent The \emph{Goal Waypoint} is unreachable.

\end{definition}

Then the \emph{Navigation Loop} is invoked  every \emph{decision time} $t_i$, \emph{Mission Control Run} (fig. \ref{fig:missionControlRunActivityDiagram}), it is described as a sequence of the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{1\textsuperscript{st}}] \textbf{Check Waypoint Reach Condition} - the \emph{UAS position} for given a \emph{time frame} $t_i$ is checked under condition (eq. \ref{eq:waypointReachCondition}).  If the condition is met continue with 2\textsuperscript{nd} step otherwise continue with 3\textsuperscript{rd} step.

    \item[\textbf{2\textsuperscript{nd}}] \textbf{Set Next Waypoint} - until the following condition is met:
    \begin{equation*}
        Goal Waypoint == Last Waypoint    
    \end{equation*}
    Set next goal waypoint like follow:
    \begin{equation*}
        Goal Waypoint = Mission.get Next Waypoint()
    \end{equation*}
    Otherwise, enforce \emph{Landing sequence} (Out of Scope).
        
    \item[\textbf{3\textsuperscript{rd}}] \textbf{Trajectory Prediction} - the \emph{Movement Buffer} is loaded with planned movements from \emph{Movement Automaton}. The \emph{future trajectory} is predicted according to (eq. \ref{eq:ourTrajectoryImplementation}):
    \begin{multline*}
        Predicted Trajectory = \\Trajectory(state=UAS.state(t_i),buffer=future Movements)
    \end{multline*}
\end{itemize}

\noindent The \emph{Predicted Trajectory} is used in 5\textsuperscript{th} step \emph{Situation Assessment}.

\paragraph{Data Fusion (4\textsuperscript{th} step)} The \emph{Data Fusion} (sec. \ref{s:sensorFusion}) in this context is \emph{Threat Sets} preparation for \emph{Avoidance Run}. It depends on the values of \emph{Boolean values} defined in (tab. \ref{tab:defuzificationRatings}) for \emph{threat} classification.

\begin{note}
    Avoidance Grid`s Data fusion (sec. \ref{s:sensorFusion}) is run in the  7\textsuperscript{th}- 10\textsuperscript{th} step (fig. \ref{fig:missionControlRunActivityDiagram}). 
\end{note}

The \emph{static obstacles} source is from \emph{LiDAR} scan received at least at the  beginning of current \emph{decision frame} $t_i$:

\begin{equation*}
        obstacles=LiDAR.scan(UAS.position(t_i))
\end{equation*}

The \emph{intruder`s} source are valid \emph{active intruders notifications} received from ADS-B In positioned to \emph{future expected positions} at \emph{decision time} $t_{i+1}$:

\begin{equation*}
        intruders=ADS-B.get Active Intruders(t_{i+1})
\end{equation*}

\begin{note}
    The \emph{Intruders} needs to be predicted for the next decision time-frame starting at time $t_{i+1}$ Due to their mobility.
\end{note}

\noindent The \emph{hard/soft constraints} are obtained from \emph{Information Sources} and the area of next decision time $t_{i+1}$ \emph{Avoidance Frame} is used as space parameter in the search. The sets of hard and soft constraints are obtained in the following manner:

\begin{equation*}
    hard Constraints= Information Sources.fuse(Avoidance Grid(t_{i+1}))
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}        
        soft Constraints=Information Sources.fuse(Avoidance Grid(t_{i+1}))
\end{equation*}

\noindent The results of \emph{Data Fusion} threats set preparation are used in the next step.


\paragraph{Invoke Navigation/Avoidance based on Situation Assessment (5\textsuperscript{th}-6\textsuperscript{th} step):} The \emph{deciding events} depending on \emph{Trajectory Prediction} ($3^{rd}$ step) and \emph{Data Fusion} ($4^{th}$ step) (fig. \ref{fig:missionControlRunActivityDiagram}) are the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{General Events} are \emph{triggered} regardless \emph{Operation Mode}. They are considered after \emph{specific mode events} are handled and \emph{Navigation/Avoidance Grid} is selected:
    \begin{enumerate}[a.]
        \item \emph{Empty Movement Buffer} ($Movement Buffer = \varnothing$) - if there is no movement in \emph{Movement buffer} to be executed (from 3\textsuperscript{rd} step: Load Trajectory), the \emph{Avoidance Run} is enforced to run with \emph{Navigation/Avoidance Reach Set Approximation} to generate the new path.
        
        \item \emph{Waypoint Reached} (2\textsuperscript{nd} step) - the \emph{Navigation Loop} run is forced to set goal \emph{Goal Waypoint}. If the \emph{last waypoint} from \emph{Mission} (sec. \ref{s:mission}) the \emph{Landing Procedure} is enforced.
        
        \item \emph{Waypoint Unreachable} - this type of event is very situations based. The \emph{Waypoint Reachability} (assumption. \ref{ass:reachableWaypoints}) has not been relaxed; therefore this event is not properly handled in approach. The \emph{implementation} considers \emph{selecting next waypoint in the mission} as a goal waypoint of the \emph{first waypoint} if \emph{unreached/unreachable waypoints} are exhausted. 
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \emph{Navigation Mode Events} are triggered if \emph{Operation Mode} is set as \emph{Navigation}:
    \begin{enumerate}[a.]
        \item \emph{Empty Navigation Grid} ($|threats| = 0$) - if \emph{movement buffer} contains at least one \emph{movement}, the \emph{Avoidance Run} is omitted. The \emph{Operation Mode} stays in \emph{Navigation Mode}.
        
        \item \emph{Collision Case Resolution} ($|ActiveCollisionCases| > 0$) - there is new/active \emph{Collision Case} (sec. \ref{sec:collisionCase}), the \emph{Navigation Reach Set Approximation} trajectories will be constrained according to  active \emph{Collision Case(s)} requirements. If there exists at least one \emph{Reachable} avoidance path, the \emph{Operation Mode} will remain \emph{Navigation}. If there is no  \emph{Reachable} avoidance path, the \emph{Operation Mode} switches to \emph{Emergency Avoidance}.
        
        \item \emph{Static Obstacle Detection} ($LiDAR.Hits > threshold$) - if \emph{static obstacle set} contains at least one \emph{detected obstacle} (eq. \ref{eq:naiveObstacleRate}) intersecting with \emph{Navigation  grid} the \emph{Operation Mode} will be \emph{switched} to \emph{Emergency Avoidance Mode}.
        
        \item \emph{Intruder Detection} ($intruders> 0$) - if \emph{active intruders set} contains at least one \emph{intruder} which expected impact area (intersection models (app. \ref{app:IntruderProbabilisticModels})) \emph{Navigation  grid} the \emph{Operation Mode} will be \emph{switched} to \emph{Emergency Avoidance Mode}.
        
        \item \emph{Hard or Soft Constraint Occurrence} ($|hard Constraints|$ $>$ $0$ $\vee$ $|soft Constraints|$ $>$ $0$) - if \emph{hard/soft constraint set} contains at least one \emph{constraints} which intersects (static constraints (sec. \ref{s:virtualConstraints}), moving constraints (def. \ref{def:movingConstraint})) \emph{Navigation  grid} the \emph{Operation Mode} will be \emph{switched} to \emph{Emergency Avoidance Mode}.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \emph{Emergency Avoidance Events} are triggered if \emph{Operation Mode} is set as \emph{Emergency Avoidance}:
    \begin{enumerate}[a.]
        \item \emph{Empty Avoidance Grid} ($|threats| = 0$) - if there is no \emph{detectable} threat, the remainder of \emph{avoidance path} is removed from \emph{Movement Buffer}. The \emph{Operation Mode} is switched to \emph{Navigation}, and new \emph{navigation path} is selected. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}



\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{5\textsuperscript{th}}] \textbf{Situation Assessment} - if there is any flag raised by \emph{Event Triggers}, there is an \emph{avoidance situation}.
    
    The \emph{Event Triggers} describe complex \emph{Operation Mode} switching. The simplified principle is the following: \emph{If UAS is in Emergency Avoidance Mode Always Invoke Avoidance Run. If UAS is in Navigation Mode Invoke Only if Necessary}.
    
    If there was event trigger continue with 7\textsuperscript{th} step, otherwise, wait for \emph{next decision time} $t_{i+1}$, execute movement and continue with 1\textsuperscript{st} step.
    
    \item[\textbf{6\textsuperscript{th}}] \textbf{Invoke Navigation/Avoidance} depending on the \emph{Operation Mode} the \emph{Reach Set/Grid} pair is selected. The future $state(t_{i+1})$ in next decision frame $t_{i+1}$ is necessary for Grid/Reach Set initialization. The \emph{next decision frame initial state} is obtained by \emph{prediction}:
    
    \begin{equation*}
        state(t_{i+1}) =  Trajectory(state(t_i),current Movement)
    \end{equation*}
    
    The \emph{Reach Set Approximation} is loaded based on \emph{mode} and $state(t_{i+1})$. The \emph{Grid} is initialized as $Free(t_{i+1})$ (eq. \ref{eq:freeDataFusion}) for all cells.
\end{itemize}



\paragraph{Avoidance Run (7\textsuperscript{th}-15\textsuperscript{th} step):} The \emph{Avoidance Run} goal is to obtain \emph{Path} represented as \emph{Trajectory}(state($t_{+1}$,MovementBuffer)) (eq. \ref{eq:ourTrajectoryImplementation}) from \emph{Navigation/Avoidance Grid} and associated \emph{Navigation/Avoidance Reach Set Approximation}.

If the \emph{Operation Mode} is set as \emph{Navigation Mode}, the algorithm continues with the 11\textsuperscript{th} step. Otherwise, the \emph{Avoidance Grid Space Assessment} is run multiple times to obtain $Reachable(t_{i+1})$ (eq. \ref{eq:ReachableDataFusion}). The \emph{Threat Data} obtained from the 4\textsuperscript{th} step are used. 

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item[\textbf{7\textsuperscript{th}}] \textbf{Apply Obstacles} - The \emph{Space assessment} (tab. \ref{tab:defuzificationRatings}) for \emph{Avoidance Grid} is calculated  with following threat modification:
    
    \begin{equation*}
        intruders = \varnothing, soft Constraints = \varnothing, hard Constraints = \varnothing
    \end{equation*}
    
    The \emph{Find Best Path} (alg. \ref{alg:FindBestPathAvoidanceGrid}) is applied, the resulting \emph{avoidance path} is labeled as \emph{Obstacle Avoidance Path}.
  
    \item[\textbf{8\textsuperscript{th}}] \textbf{Apply Intruders} - The \emph{Space assessment} (tab. \ref{tab:defuzificationRatings}) for \emph{Avoidance Grid} is calculated  with following threat modification:
    
    \begin{equation*}
        soft Constraints = \varnothing, hard Constraints = \varnothing
    \end{equation*}
    
    The \emph{Find Best Path} (alg. \ref{alg:FindBestPathAvoidanceGrid}) is applied, the resulting \emph{avoidance path} is labeled as \emph{Intruders Avoidance Path}.
    
    \item[\textbf{9\textsuperscript{th}}] \textbf{Apply Hard Constraints} - The \emph{Space assessment} (tab. \ref{tab:defuzificationRatings}) for \emph{Avoidance Grid} is calculated  with following threat modification:
    
    \begin{equation*}
        hard Constraints = \varnothing
    \end{equation*}
    
    The \emph{Find Best Path} (alg. \ref{alg:FindBestPathAvoidanceGrid}) is applied, the resulting \emph{avoidance path} is labeled as \emph{Hard Constraint Avoidance Path}.
    
    \item[\textbf{10\textsuperscript{th}}] \textbf{Apply Soft Constraints} - The \emph{Space assessment} (tab. \ref{tab:defuzificationRatings}) for \emph{Avoidance Grid} is calculated  without any modification.
    
    The \emph{Find Best Path} (alg. \ref{alg:FindBestPathAvoidanceGrid}) is applied, the resulting \emph{avoidance path} is labeled as \emph{Soft Constraints Avoidance Path}.
    
    \begin{note}
        The 7\textsuperscript{th} to 10\textsuperscript{th} steps are code-optimized for efficient calculation.
    \end{note}
    
    \item[\textbf{11\textsuperscript{th}}] \textbf{Select Path} -  based on \emph{Operation Mode} the \emph{Navigation/Avoidance Path} is selected.
    
    The \emph{Navigation Path} for \emph{Navigation Mode} is selected by a standard \emph{Find Best Path} (alg. \ref{alg:FindBestPathAvoidanceGrid}) procedure. The \emph{Navigation Reach Set Approximation} can be constrained by \emph{Rule Engine} (fig. \ref{fig:RuleEngineInstanceLevels}).
    
    The \emph{Avoidance Path} for \emph{Emergency Avoidance Mode} is selected from \emph{Collected Avoidance Paths} with the following priority:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[1.] \emph{Soft Constraints Avoidance Path} - if exists continue with 12\textsuperscript{th} step, if does not exist try to select:
        
        \item[2.] \emph{Hard Constraints Avoidance Path} - if exists continue with 12\textsuperscript{th} step, if does not exist try to select:
        
        \item[3.] \emph{Intruders Avoidance Path} - if exists continue with 12\textsuperscript{th} step, if does not exist try to select:
        
        \item[4.] \emph{Obstacle Avoidance Path} - continue with the 12\textsuperscript{th} step.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{note}
        The \emph{Waypoint Reachability} (assumption \ref{ass:reachableWaypoints}) is weakened to the point that it is necessary for the waypoint to be \emph{Reachable} only in static obstacle environment. The \emph{Constrained} and \emph{Occupied} spaces are shrunk in the following matter to increase UAS survival chances. There are following relaxations with their conditions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[1.] \emph{Soft Constraint Relaxation} - they are breakable by default.  This kind of situation is allowed to happen under any circumstances. 
            
            \item[2.] \emph{Hard Constraints Relaxation} - they can be broken in case of emergency (airspace constraints) or UAS robust build (Weather Constraints). This kind of situation is allowed under very specific conditions depending on \emph{broken constraint} severity.
            
            \item[3.] \emph{Intruder Occupied Space Relaxation} - this can be broken if and only if there is guarantee the Intruder dynamic and navigation algorithm allows to avoid \emph{Collision} with UAS. This relaxation should be used as \emph{the last resort}.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{note}
    
    \item[\textbf{12\textsuperscript{th}}] \textbf{Load Movements} - the \emph{Movement Buffer} is flushed for \emph{future decision times} $t_{i+1}, \dots, t_{i+k}$. The \emph{Navigation/Avoidance Path} movements are pushed into \emph{Movement Buffer} instead. The \emph{executed movement} for \emph{decision time} $t_i$ remains (because movement is executed at this time point).
    
    \item[\textbf{13\textsuperscript{th}}] \textbf{Set Next Decision} - the \emph{next decision point} is set depending on circumstances:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[1.] Navigation Mode (no active collision cases) - \emph{Decision Point} is set as the point before \emph{UAS} enters into \emph{Crash Zone} (fig. \ref{fig:gridZonesMissionControl}) in \emph{Navigation Grid}.
        
        \item[2.] \emph{Navigation Mode (at least one active collision case)} - \emph{Decision Point} is set after \emph{next movement execution}. Current decision point $UAS.Position(t_i)$, next decision point $UAS.Position(t_{i+1})$.
        
        \item[3.] \emph{Emergency Avoidance Mode (any circumstances)} - \emph{Decision Point} is set after the \emph{next movement execution}. Current decision point $UAS.Position(t_i)$, next decision point $UAS.Position(t_{i+1})$.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item[\textbf{14\textsuperscript{th}}] \textbf{Execute Movement} - the \emph{First Movement} from \emph{Movement Buffer} is loaded to be executed in decision time frame $[t_{i+1}, t_{i+2}[$. 
    
    \item[\textbf{15\textsuperscript{th}}] \textbf{Finish Avoidance Run} - if the \emph{UAS} is flying, continue with 1\textsuperscript{st} step. 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Decision Frame:} The \emph{mission control run} (fig. \ref{fig:missionControlRunActivityDiagram}) describes the overall process in \emph{sequence}. The \emph{orchestration overview} is given in (fig. \ref{fig:misisonControlRunOrchestrationDiagram}).

The key idea is to explain what happens in one \emph{decision frame}. The \emph{mission control run} is implemented as multi-thread application which sends the signals between threads. Each thread is the semi-independent process with forced synchronization on \emph{decision frame switch}.

    \label{fig:misisonControlRunOrchestrationDiagram}
\end{figure}

\noindent The notable threads and their roles \& responsibilities are summarized like follow:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[1.] \emph{Sensor Fusion} - responsible for processing real-time sensor array (sec. \ref{s:SensorFusionDefinition}). The output is a partial known world assessment (sec. \ref{s:KnownWorld}). \emph{Obstacle detection} and \emph{intruder detection} events can be risen by this thread. 
    
    \item[2.] \emph{Data Fusion} - responsible for enhancing data from \emph{sensor fusion} by mixing data originating from \emph{information sources} (sec. \ref{s:dataFusionDefinition}). The information sources used in this work contains constraints originating from \emph{geo-fencing}, \emph{weather}, \emph{airspace restrictions}. This thread is delayed by \emph{sensor fusion}. A \emph{data fusion procedure} strongly depends on the \emph{operational space context} (controlled/non-controlled airspace). The output of \emph{data fusion} is full \emph{known world assessment} (sec. \ref{s:KnownWorld}, \ref{s:sensorFusion}). The \emph{UTM-related} and \emph{constraint related} events can arise from \emph{data fusion}.
    
    \item[3.] \emph{Event Buffer} -  special data structure to store, raise, handle, prioritize events raised by other threads. 
    
    The \emph{implemented events} are listed in the  5\textsuperscript{th}-6\textsuperscript{th} step of \emph{mission control run}. The events can be categorized like follow:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[a.] \emph{Planned events} - raised in previous decision frames to be executed in actual or future \emph{decision frame}. 
        
        \item[b.] \emph{Intermediate events} - raised in \emph{actual decision frame} by other threads to be solved intermediate. 
    \end{itemize}
    
    The event buffer thread executes following event-related activities:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[a.] \emph{Storing} - the \emph{events} are stored in the \emph{event log}. The trace is useful for process and rules fine-tuning. 
        
        \item[b.] \emph{Raising} - the combination of events (multiple avoidance events) (example sec. \ref{s:testRuleMixed}) can trigger additional avoidance behavior in the form of combined-event.
        
        \item[c.] \emph{Handling} - the events are handled by invoking the \emph{situation assessment} or by rule engine invocation (sec. \ref{s:RuleEngineArchitecture}).
        
        \item[d.] \emph{Prioritizing} - the multiple events can rise during one \emph{decision frame}. Some events cannot be merged and need to have proper prioritization before handling, like the \emph{obstacle detection} events before \emph{intruder detection event}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item[4.] \emph{Situation Assessment} - invoked by \emph{event buffer} to assess the situation, responsible for proper \emph{avoidance run} (sec. \ref{s:aviudabceGridRun}) dataset preparation and invocation. The main responsibility is to check \emph{planned trajectory feasibility} stored in \emph{movement buffer} as \emph{planned movements}.
    
    \item[5.] \emph{Avoidance Run} - invoked by \emph{necessity to plan trajectory} originating from \emph{event buffer} or \emph{situation assessment} threads. The avoidance run produces one or multiple \emph{avoidance/navigation} feasible trajectories according to  the 7\textsuperscript{th}-11\textsuperscript{th} step of \emph{mission control run}.
    
    \item[6.] \emph{Movement Buffer} - represents \emph{movement automaton implementation} (sec. \ref{s:movementAutomatonDefinition}). The movement automaton consumes \emph{movement automaton buffer} each decision frame contains exactly one \emph{movement}. The movements can be viewed as:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[a.] \emph{Past movements} - already executed movements in \emph{past decision frames}.
        
        \item[b.] \emph{Executed movement} - actually executed movement in the current decision frame, this movement cannot be changed.
        
        \item[c.] \emph{Future movements} - future planned movements to be executed after \emph{current decision frame} expires. These movements outline planned trajectory (predictor mode sec. \ref{s:referenceTrajectoryGenerator}).
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item[7.] \emph{Feasible Trajectory} - consists of \emph{future planned movements} taking place directly after the \emph{correct decision frame}. If its necessary, the planned trajectory in movement buffer is no longer feasible, the planned movements will throw away and replaced by \emph{trajectory movements}. 
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\noindent The \emph{roles \& responsibilities} of each thread have been explained to outline their orchestration and roles in \emph{mission control run} (fig. \ref{fig:missionControlRunActivityDiagram}). The numbered steps in (fig. \ref{fig:misisonControlRunOrchestrationDiagram}) shows the threads orchestration in the following manner:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[1.] \emph{Sensor \& Data fusion data set preparation/collection} - the sensor readings are collected through multiple past and over current \emph{decision frame}. Each sensor reading is filtered and processed according to best practices. 
    
    The raw information from various data sources is loaded for relevant space clusters. The relevant space clusters are determined based on \emph{UAS expected position}. 
    
    \item[2.] \emph{Sensor fusion} - the readings from sensors are preprocessed according to (sec. \ref{s:staticObstacles}, \ref{s:intruders}).
    
    \item[3.] \emph{Data fusion} - the information sources are preprocessed according to (sec. \ref{s:staticObstacles}, \ref{s:intruders}).
    
    \item[4.] \emph{Event evaluation process} - the events are evaluated, if there is any triggering event (5\textsuperscript{th}-6\textsuperscript{th} mission control run steps) the situation evaluation process is called.
    
    \item[5.] \emph{Situation evaluation process} - the situation is evaluated according to 5\textsuperscript{th}-6\textsuperscript{th} mission control run steps.
    
    \item[6.] \emph{Feasible trajectory selection process} - from collected \emph{navigation/avoidance trajectories} (7\textsuperscript{th}-10\textsuperscript{th} mission control run steps). If there are more feasible trajectories (increasing threat) the one compliant with most of the threats is selected.
    
    \item[7.] \emph{Movement execution} - the movement for the \emph{current decision frame} is being executed.
    
    \item[8.] \emph{Movement buffer swap} - if there is a new \emph{feasible trajectory} the future movements for next decision frames are flushed away. The movement buffer is then filled with \emph{feasible trajectory movements}.
    \begin{note}
        This step impacts the duration of future \emph{decision frames}.
