What can be done differently
\begin{itemize}
	\item planar/euc grid: cube cells vs planar cells:
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item there is good rate - increasing distance from uas, increasing cell volume , decreasing importance
	    \item the linear cell count growth with increasing distance, covering more space vs quadratic cell count in euclidiean
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Intruder uncertainity model ideas:
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item intruder as line/curve ontersection
	    \item intruder as movement automaton simulated trajectory
	    \item intruder well clear implementation as rule - potential fields
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Probabilistic vs rating approach:
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item Probablistic approach - too formal
	    \item Deterministic approach - true/false - too constrained
	    \item rating +  post deterministic: 
	    \begin{itemize}
	        \item freedom of probablilstic
	        \item regulation and business accomodation/introduction
	    \end{itemize}
	    \item Ratings reflects probabilities, they share basic mechanisms
	    \item man made rules incorporation - some things are automatic no go, even if probabilistic approach says its "safe"
	    \item Situation assessment trough tresholding
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
