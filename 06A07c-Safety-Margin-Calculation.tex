\subsection{(W) Safety margin calculation}\label{s:safetyMarginCalculation}
    How to assess safety margin and what impacts it:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Own uncertainity 
        \item Intruder uncertainity 
        \item Weather
        \item Airspace
        \item UTM corrections
    \end{itemize}
    
    Note \emph{Both UAS} decision times were \emph{synchronized}, this is not an assumption, but it shows critical performance. Usually safety margin is bloated for:
            \begin{equation}\label{safetyMarginBloat}
                safetyMarginBloat = \left( \begin{aligned}
                &intruderVelocity \times\dots \\ &intruderDecisionFrame \end{aligned}\right)[m,ms^{-1},s]
            \end{equation}
