\section{Situation Representation in the Avoidance Grid}\label{sec:situationAssessment}
\noindent This section gives overview how different types of threat are projected into \emph{avoidance grid}:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item\emph{Obstacles} (sec. \ref{s:staticObstacles}) - how static obstacles are represented, how map data are processed and represented, how concept of visibility impact certainty of obstacle in space.
	
	\item\emph{Intruders} (sec. \ref{s:intruders}) - how intruders are projected into avoidance grid, how great is probability to encounter specific intruder in given space and time.
	
	\item\emph{Constraints} (sec. \ref{s:virtualConstraints}) - how are constraints like geo-fencing or weather represented, how is their impact on space calculated.
	
	\item\emph{Data Fusion} (sec. \ref{s:sensorFusion}) - how is final threat in cell calculated, how this threat impact the safety of passing trajectories, how we know which cells in grid are safe.
\end{enumerate}
