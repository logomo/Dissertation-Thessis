\section{(W) Event Based Avoidance}\label{sec:EventBasedAvoidance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduce the context for Event based avoidance: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Preventive DAA - before flight preparation
        \item Event-based DAA - reaction window in minutes, usually cooperative via notifications and other methods
        \item Reactive DAA - you know the drill boys ..., reaction window in 10th of seconds ...
    \end{itemize}
    \item Introduce the process of notification and Event Resolution
    \item Outline hierarchy in U(A)TM controlled space 
    \item Outline expected minimal set of data sources
\end{itemize}

\subsection{(W) Mid-Air Collision Prevention}\label{sec:MidairCollisionPrevention}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Identify and dispute shortcomings of Aircraft classification in ICAO
    \item List of MAC events
    \item For each event describe trigger and resolution 
    \item cite barrel \cite{welzl1991smallest}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{(W) Weather Impact}\label{sec:WeatherImpact}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item do not use term "climate change"
        \item critical events are getting more localized and their magnitude is increased
        \item List of Weather event
        \item Discuss weather mitigation
    \end{itemize}
    
    \emph{Weather Impact} on transportation in general has been introduced by Koetse in study \cite{koetse2009impact}.
    
    \emph{Weather-based} preemptive planning have been introduced into manned aviation in 2015 \cite{yamashita2015climate}. \TBD{This one shows global model impact}
    
    \emph{Severe Weather Condition Detection Capabilities} for current level of standard aviation equipment have been reviewed in \cite{smith2016multi} \TBD{This one shows intermediate weather detection}

    \emph{Icing risk} in localized environment have been predicted based on numerical model \cite{thompson2017numerical}. It is shown that icing can be prevented by \emph{planned} and \emph{reactive} avoidance.
    
    \emph{Weather Models} can be extracted from \emph{Climate and weather model archive at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration} \cite{rutledge2006nomads}.
