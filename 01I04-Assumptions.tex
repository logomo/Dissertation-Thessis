        \item  Guarantee feasible safe trajectory in open world space at low altitude of the flight. Manage information resources about real obstacles, weather obstacles, ATM restrictions.
        \item create previously mentioned points as assumptions, xxx is accessible to feasible extent, etc ...
    \end{itemize}
