    \begin{itemize}
        \item Clarification where are we at the \emph{Obstacle Avoidance}.
        \item Assumption that \emph{Preemptive avoidance} could fail.
        \item \emph{Basic idea} is to cover \emph{Reactive avoidance} by creating discretization of \emph{Avoidance space,Reach set, Obstacle space, Intruder space ...}
        \item \emph{Navigation concept} can be reused in \emph{Event based avoidance} to address \emph{Weather, Rules of the air, Geo-fencing}.
        \item mention discretizaiton, general algorithm, UTM, ...
        \item Aircraft conflict prediction mentioned in \cite{prandini2008application}.
