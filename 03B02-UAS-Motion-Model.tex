\section{(W) UAS Motion Model}\label{s:uavMotionModel}
    \emph{To be done here:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Continious time model.
        \item Discrete time model.
        \item Properties like controllability, observability, invariance to a set of points.
        \item Taken mostly from \emph{Research plan}, \emph{Article}, and \emph{MPC report}
    \end{itemize}
